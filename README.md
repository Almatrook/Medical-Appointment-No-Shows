<!-- Overview -->
## Overview


Healthcare expenses have cost a fortune. The average hourly pay of a physician is considered high regardless of the different salary structure around the globe. The cost of that time slot remains the same whether or not a patient missed his/her medical appointment.

In this project, the data associated with scheduled patient appointments will be analyzed. In particular, the findings from trends among the patients who no show and the others who attended a doctor appointment. This project aims to understand the possibility of predicting patients who fail to appear in a medical's appointment.

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

## Details
The dataset has been looked up and managed a few problems like unifying names and type conversion. In the investigation stage,  selecting the most of independent variables in the dataset and comparing them to the dependent one (no_show). As this was only an exploratory analysis stage, there are many potential correlations may remain uncovered. The dataset needs to be investigated further with more statistical analysis to potentially reveal new insights and correlations.

## Findings

1. Tuesday and Wednesday are most weekdays for patients to show up in doctor's appointment even though there are no significant difference with other days. As result of the number of approved appointment, there are 30 visits on Saturday and none on Sunday.
2. Female has the highest percentage of missing their medical appointment with almost twice than male.
3. Despite receiving an SMS notification has increased patients obligation on their appointment by triple time than patients who Ignored notification, there are more than half of people who visited the doctor without receiving SMS. The most dominant percentage of them was female.
4. The most classification of patients age who shows up are young adults(18 - 40) by women higher than men.
5. For all studied independent variables, the distributions of patients attendance look similar. However, patient gender is more prominent than others.
