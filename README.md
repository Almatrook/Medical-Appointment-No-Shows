<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Healthcare expenses have cost a fortune. The average hourly pay of a physician is considered high regardless of the different salary structure around the globe. The cost of that time slot remains the same whether or not a patient missed his/her medical appointment.

In this project, the data associated with scheduled patient appointments will be analyzed. In particular, the findings from trends among the patients who no show and the others who attended a doctor appointment. This project aims to understand the possibility of predicting patients who fail to appear in a medical's appointment.

The original problem description and data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/home
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.
